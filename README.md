### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**lindsayds/lindsayds** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on figuring out how comupters work (not very well, I may add...)
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning that I have no concept of technology.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about ophthalmic biomaterials (thrilling, I know).
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm trying to minor in sustainability.
